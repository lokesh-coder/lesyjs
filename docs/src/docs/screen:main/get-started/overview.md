Lesy is a super cool javascript framework to build CLI applications with ease. There are quite a few awesome libraries are existing in the node eco-system, namely commander, gluegun, yargs. They are really super nice, production ready, good community support. But they all lack few things. They are scalability and non-futuristic.

### Few things to consider Lesy for your next project

- **Language**: Full support for Typescript with @types
- **Boilerplate**: Write less code. whether its a dead simple project or complex one.
- **Flexibility**: Able to change complete behavior with middlewares
- **Extensions**: Add cool functionalities with plugins
- **Platform**: Write once and run in CLI or UI
- **Performance**: It is just faster than existing libraries. Benchmark inside.
- **Testing**: Dedicated testing setup for unit test and integration test
- **Lot more**: Features, sub commands, existing plugins, Boilerplate generator...

### Why is the name Lesy?

Well, there is no specific meaning for Lesy. The whole project is build with the mindset of simple and easy. Whether it is a code or documentation or name or logo, everything should be simple and easy. Name **Lesy** sounds cool and short.

Same way, it is not related to penguin logo. Penguin is cute right? Lets make that as a logo and name it Lesy!!

You should give it a try!
